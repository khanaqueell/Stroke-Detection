# Stroke-Detection
"Stroke Detection using Random Forest" is a data-driven approach aimed at identifying individuals who are at risk of experiencing a stroke by leveraging machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest algorithm.
This methodology involves collecting relevant medical data such as demographic information, medical history, lifestyle factors, and potentially biomarkers like blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and glucose levels. This data is then processed and utilized to train a Random Forest classifier, a popular ensemble learning technique capable of handling complex datasets with high dimensionality.
The Random Forest algorithm constructs multiple decision trees during the training phase and combines their outputs to make predictions. In the context of stroke detection, the Random Forest model learns to recognize patterns and relationships within the input data that are indicative of stroke risk.
Once the model is trained on a sufficiently large and diverse dataset, it can be deployed to predict the likelihood of stroke for new individuals based on their input features. These predictions can serve as valuable tools for healthcare professionals in identifying high-risk patients who may benefit from early intervention and preventive measures.
This project represents a promising approach to leveraging machine learning for proactive healthcare management, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare costs through early detection and targeted intervention strategies.
